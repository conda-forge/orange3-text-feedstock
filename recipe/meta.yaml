  summary: Orange3 add-on for analyzing textual data.

  description: |
    Orange add-on for text mining. It provides access to publicly available
    data, like NY Times, Twitter and PubMed. Further, it provides tools for
    preprocessing, constructing vector spaces (like bag-of-words and topic
    modeling) and visualizations like word cloud and geo map. All features
    can be combined with powerful data mining techniques from the Orange
    data mining framework.
